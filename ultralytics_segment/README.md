# Bin Segmentation (Ultralytics)

This folder contains the code used for training models on segmenting bin items, such as cardboard boxed, packaging, etc.

For instruction on training models with Ultralytic YOLOV11, here is their Google Collab notebook: https://colab.research.google.com/github/ultralytics/ultralytics/blob/main/examples/tutorial.ipynb#scrollTo=1NcFxRcFdJ_O

When running the code, you might need to change to directories listed in [USER]/AppData/Roaming/Ultralytics/settings.json to the project folder locations.
